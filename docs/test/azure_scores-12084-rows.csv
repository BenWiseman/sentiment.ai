1506,1,"i would not like to reiterate all the pros and cons other people have mentioned. to me, the most defining difference of airbnb from other companies i have seen is the company's mission and positive, well-cultivated work culture.       although airbnb is a for-profit corporation, we put a lot of stress on in our mission - """"""""belong anywhere"""""""". before i traveled on airbnb after becoming an employee, i had different kinds... of traveling experiences and have started to think traditional quick and hurried ways of travel is not right and even possibly wrong. although airbnb makes money from guests and hosts, we also try hard to communicate the reason why you should start traveling with locals on airbnb, instead of using hotels. travel experiences on airbnb are very different from person to person and can be transformative. i feel i work for a company that can change the way people think about traveling.    airbnb has a distinctive culture. people are smart and at the same time have interesting stories to share, and everyone values learning from others. during my cultural fit interview (airbnb is the only company for which i have ever done a culture fit interview for an engineering position), one of my interviewers asked me “what can you teach me right now?"""""""" that was one of the most difficult interview questionsi have ever had. after a bit of hesitation, i taught my interviewer how to practice standing meditation, which i learned just a week before the interview at an insight meditation session. we ask this question to many candidates. we encourage people to share a """"""""fun fact"""""""" when you are first introducing yourself or when you are presenting at team meetings. i have learned people at airbnb have so many interesting experiences to share and feel humbled to work with them everyday. we have a """"""""hands on nerds"""""""" session organized by one of our engineers where we teach """"""""skills"""""""" to each other - these can be technical or be non-technical like how to do screen printing or how to dance bhangra, an indian traditional dance. this culture also applies to day-to-day work. after an incident caused by human errors is resolved, engineers write a postmortem and share it with all product team members to teach and share, not to blame and ask for an apology. senior engineers are willing to spend time discussing your mistakes to help you become a better engineer. every weekly engineering meeting starts with appreciation time when people thank others who helped them or had done great work in that week.    for a general perspective about working at airbnb, read other people's reviews. factors like compensation, hours, and perk matter to me and what is being said by others is largely true. but for me, the mission and the culture are more important reasons that makes me feel excited to go to work everyday.","pro",1,"en"

""""""""top performers"""""""" can expect 2.5 percent every other year or so.  it's not even enough to keep up with inflation.  they usually allow an offices salary to go up by 1.5 percent which means the average raise has to be 1.5 percent.  some people will get 2 percent.  most get 0.  99 percent of """"""""promotions"""""""" are lateral meaning no raise.  if you go from handling non-injury claims to injury claims you get not a dollar more even though you take on twice the work.  it's insane.  there are no real bonuses or incentives other than your pay check.  i won employee of the month several times and got a $5 gift card.    *micro-management: most of the industry uses scripts but allstate lives by them.  if you deviate from the script at all (even if you get the wording wrong) and someone listens to your call, you will be told your performance is not satisfactory.  they are taking administrative tasks like time keeping and stuff away from managers so they can spend more time micro-managing and coaching.  they will record calls, track number of calls and how long and context does not matter to them.    *no opportunities: not one person was promoted to management at any point i was with allstate.  they are actually going down managers right now on purpose so don't think you can get promoted in 5-20 years because you won't.  be happy being an adjuster because that is all you ever will be.    *culture: they are going through """"""""culture change"""""""" over the last two years.  but no one can tell you what that means so they just label everything culture change.  it's actually funny.  they will change staples in the stapler and then let everyone know and call it culture change.  they said they wanted to move the focus back to happy employees but they have done just the opposite.  our office turn over has jumped dramatically.  they said they wanted to encourage movement outside of claims to get good people where they can do the most good but of the 10 people i know of who wanted to try to transfer, all were told no because they were needed too much in their current role.  it is a catch-22.  if you are great at your job, they won't let  you transfer because they can't lose you.  if you are bad at your job, they obviously won't let you transfer.  my advice, be average and fly under the radar.    *this is sort of culture/management: this is a typical example of the type of stuff they do.  for 5 years they were pretty flexible with start times.  you don't clock in or anything.  if you were a few minutes late, no biggy.  you just stayed a few minutes late to make up for it.  no one abused it.  without warning, our office boss decides he is going to change that but he doesn't tell anyone.  what he does do, he has a manager go through the phone log in time (which we were never required to log into right away) and the security log to see what time people swiped their key card (even though people always walked in together).  if you swiped your key card more than 1 second after your start time, you were given an occurrence.  he actually went back 6 months and handed out occurrences like they were going out of style.  90 percent of the office was written up.  just think about how many times in the last 6 months you have opened the door at work 1 second late.  if that answer is more than 3, you are in big big trouble and being considered for termination.","con",0,"en"

(pro tip, if for some reason you want to work there, make sure you know everything about baseball),  several years before my time at ansys was over, he actually forbade any discussion of """"""""office morale"""""""". one of his catch phrases was """"""""you can always find a different job."""""""" despite this, you will be expected to drink the kool aid and show unwavering enthusiasm for the company, the customer, and, especially, your personal projects.    nepotism is rampant in the the hiring and promotion of the staff.  the """"""""supervisors"""""""" busy themselves seeking the director's favor  and working on personal projects (there's that phrase, again) instead of actually leading their teams.  in order to have time to complete these projects, the actual supervisor duties have been delegated to senior crcs (who, with few exceptions, are personal friends or a spouse of a supervisor). if you know any of them, by all means, you should submit a resume.    pay raises and bonuses are insultingly low, barely above inflation. when it is time for your yearly review, you will almost certainly rate a consistent 2 to 3, on a 5 -point scale.  for every criterion of the review. it is an open secret in the company that the director has instructed his underlings to not rate anyone a 3.5 or above, unless your project catches the praise of upper management. your supervisor, who likely did nothing but listen to you report on the work you did on the project, will receive a higher score than you for your work.  no other department rates their staff in this manner.    every trivial piece of information is treated as top secret, and secrets are traded almost as a commodity amongst the entire department.  a culture of backstabbing also exists.  my advice is to keep your ears open and your mouth closed.","con",0,"en"

11924,0,"-without extensive outside experience, or maaaaaaaaaany years on the job, you kind of hit a ceiling at the store manager position if you are trying to work your way up from the bottom. after store manager there is the district manager position where you get the company car, the company cell phone, the great salary, the respect, etc. but it's a very narrow door with a lot of people trying to fit through it. expect to stay store manager pretty much forever unless you have extensive outside experience or equally extensive educational qualifications.   -given the nature of a retail job, especially a diverse and demanding one like this, employee turnover is high. so if you want to accel and be a great employee, expect to be taking on an absolute ton of work and responsibility sometimes because generally speaking, your store will be understaffed, or at the very least undertrained. if you're on the counter with just 1 or 2 new guys, you basically have to run the store by yourself because it takes a new employee a few months to be of any real use in a place like this.   -training is very """"""""trial by fire"""""""" at essentially every position in the company. basically you get hired, flip through a 3.5 inch binder of """"""""corporate policies,"""""""" take some useless """"""""training modules"""""""" on the computer for a shift or two, and then you're put on the counter and you just learn everything as you go. your first few weeks will be very demanding on you, and even more demanding on the one veteran employee who has to run the store by his/herself while you stumble your way along.   -corporate """"""""culture"""""""" if you want to call it that, can be exceptionally lame at times. i'm all about team spirit, but you have a couple of store meetings every year, and you have to recite stupid cheers and spell out """"""""autozone"""""""" letter for letter with your body, and listen to ridiculous rap videos about answering the phone and providing customer service. seriously. you will want to pour battery acid in your eyes. day to day it's fine, but on those rare ocassions that you have to do that garbage, you will question yourself if it is worth living any longer.    -there is a """"""""dress code"""""""" not a dress """"""""uniform,"""""""" so you have to provide all of your own stuff, which sucks and can get expensive, especially if you live in a winter climate, because you will be out there in the snow changing batteries and wipers and whatnot. even a basic uniform will run you a minimum of 50 bucks. black shoes, socks, belt, sturdy pants, plus your shirt, which is about 12 bucks for a polo, and 20 for a button-up. add in the winter, and now you need an """"""""autozone approved"""""""" jacket, hat, gloves, whatever. plus if you get even a few drops of battery acid on your shirt, there will be a hole burned in it the next morning and you will have to buy a new one. get a stain from a greasy car part or leaking oil bottle? snag your shirt on a shelf fixture? too bad. shell out another 20 bucks.   -i understand sales goals and selling programs, but sometimes the bar is set unnattainbly high at autozone, and you get zero margin room for having a store that just lost a valuable employee, or a store where half of your staff is still in the training period, etc. upper management is very report based. they have no idea who you are or what is going on in your store, they just look at spreadsheets every morning and call around to yell at everyone. you can be struggling just to have enough staff to keep the friggen' doors open and you will still have relentless pressure to hit some high sales goal for whatever the product or program of the month is. it can get very tiring when the management method employed is all negative reinforcement, and what is actually going on at store level is never taken into account. sometimes it feels like the only motivation to drive selling programs and push product is just to not get yelled at over the phone every morning, which works short term, but is a terrible long term management strategy.   -the worst customer will often be treated better than the best employee. for example, the return and warranty policy is highly abused, but as a sales manager, when you try to enforce the rules (not returning something that was used for example) just watch what happens. that customer can merely call the district manager, whine, and then you will get a call from your dm that you're a piece of **** who's failing to provide """"""""customer service"""""""" and order you to look that ******* in the eye (this customer will now have a smug look on his face of course) and """"""""apoligize"""""""" about your """"""""mistake"""""""" and give that person free money. it's horrible, and it's insulting. autozone will always cut their employee's off at the knees as soon as any customer disagrees with them for any reason. if you don't want us to enforce a policy, don't bother having it in the first place.  -the pay can be pretty low considering how the company makes money hand over fist.","con",0,"en"
