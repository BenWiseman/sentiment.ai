When you ask employees what they love about Acuity, they of... course say, the rock climbing wall, ferris wheel to enjoy during social hours every even Thursday (which instills a deep rooted sense of community), the 27,000 sq ft free onsite workout facility; but what employees also focus on are the people. Time and again, we experience employees supporting one another through challenges at work and even at life. With this deep sense of community, and personally aligned values, there is a desire to show up to work and enjoy the mission together. Personally, I have experienced support from all levels of the organization to help me grow to the professional I have become. As a millennial, this is my first full-time job out of college and I have no desire to look anywhere else. God bless America and God bless Acuity.",1

On a personal side, they provide many opportunities to talk with upper management and my manager is constantly checking in with me to see if there's ways Acuity can provide further education or if there's other areas within my role that I would like to explore further.  They want to make sure I'm not getting bored with my position....
2. From a company perspective, we have bi-weekly happy hours and monthly """"parties"""" during the work day just to keep things fun. 

Benefits (401k, insurance, working from home, etc.) are great, there are many clubs to get involved in so you can meet people with similar hobbies, and there is a gym on site with free classes every day of the week.",1
"Good benefits, great executives, good pay, care about employees",1
"Acuity cares about its employees. We have amazing health benefits, an onsite fitness center with fitness classes, mothers rooms, a subsidized cafeteria full of healthy options, amazing walking paths inside and out of the building, and onsite affordable massage therapy too. Acuity also cares about our retirement. Acuity contributes generously whether we do or not, invites retirees to join us at the summer picnic and... the Christmas party (both amazing) and offers a very generous retirement bonus.  And, of course, Acuity cares about our career development. Acuity reimburses approved continuing education, makes amazing CE videos, Institutes exams can be taken onsite, training seminars for soft and career advancement skills are available and encouraged, Acuity promotes from within, and employees are empowered and engaged.  We care about each other too. Everyone is really nice. You can't walk through the halls without being blown away by people smiling and waving. And, Acuity cares about the community. Employees give generously to various causes throughout the year and acuity makes amazing contributions to local schools, hospitals, and life changing community programs. I am proud to say I work at Acuity.",1
"Your work matters.
The environment is inviting and facilitates learning and fun.
The culture is infectious. 
Work hour and schedule flexibility.",1
"Corporate culture is amazing. They make it easy to come to work, involve family in as many aspects as possible and promote a healthy work/life balance. Everyone walks around with a smile on their face and appreciation is expressed from top management on down. The officers' outlook for the future makes me confident investing my time and effort here, as I know Acuity will continue to be a strong company for many years... to come. I feel valued as an employee, confident in the skills I've been taught and I know I am supported by my supervisors.",1
"Company really seems to value their employees! My previous employer did not give that impression but senior management at ACUITY really values the work the employees do to keep this company on the continued track of success.  The home office building is impressive to work in and there is a cafeteria and 24/7 gym located in the building as well.  ACUITY gives town halls in their round theater to all employees that... give a transparency of how the company is doing that very few companies do. 

Benefits are top notch too with 10%  match on your 401k,  great health insurance, work from home ( varies depending on your position), and an amazing summer picnic and Christmas party.

No goals in commercial underwriting to write a certain amount of premium which shows this company is smart about writing profitable business and growing.",1

Happy hours to get to know co-workers.",1
"Companie events for comodary 
401k is fantastic",1
"I can't speak for other departments, only my experience in MIS.

Acuity truly has a great company environment. On the whole, there is thoughtfulness behind benefits and facilities offered, and almost exclusively good spirit and morale among employees. The longer I work here the more I appreciate the attention to industry regulations, standards, overall business integrity, and generous local community goodwill, as... well as the wisdom and long-term vision that seems to consistently put the company's competition to shame. That's the kind of reputation I'd look for in any employer: respect and wisdom. I'd also note that organizations seem to consistently take identity and character from the CEO down; Ben is among the best in both regards, and it shows.

One improvement that's stood out in the past few years is more attention being given by MIS management to employee input in the teams new hires join and in existing employees transitioning to new teams.",1

Executive leadership is top notch, proven by the companies success. They have earned numerous awards across multiple business units and are recognized as a Great Place To Work. It is a fantastic place to start a career, but depending on your career goals it may not be the best time... investment for long term employment. Despite enormous growth and expansion, recent changes in hiring standards, below market salaries, and rising turnover rates of senior talent are reshaping the company culture.

-Extremely generous to their employees with benefits, gifts and recognition.
-Genuinely treat their employees as valued members of the organization.

They don't think they are too big to engage with Associates at all levels.   They... are intentional about building relationships, understanding the employees' concerns and building a competitive workforce.  They invest in employee development and competitive certifications to upskill Associates.  They ensure employees are aware of changes and the why behind it.

"This company really gives you the tools to be the best you can be.  A lot of duties must be self driven and if you have that drive, they can help give you the tools to exceed in everything you do.

"Aflac was a career stepping stone with lots of opportunities for learning.",1
"As a company, Aflac is stelar and a good place for a very profitable career.  I've had an Accident Policy for several years, it's been a life-saver many times (broken tooth, sprained wrist, broken bone in hand, bulging disc in neck, crushed foot, and the list goes on....we received money on every injury).  As with most companies in the insurance business, it does take time to build your pipeline.  The primary goal... as an employee is to develop a stream of residual income. This takes time and effort and a good Trainer. Most people tend to burn out after a few months of hard work (cold calls and follow-up, etc).  It's hard work! But once you see that monthly residual check (and continue to grow it), life can be pretty good.  They don't cover the costs for getting licensed, but you have to have some skin in the game...right? As for all of the unhappy """"interns"""".....it makes perfect sense, this is a longer term career move and working for a few months can be discouraging. If you are willing to work hard and work smart, Aflac can be very lucrative.",1

Holiday shutdown. Everyone gets off from Dec 20th... till Jan 1st. That's amazing.
Very competitive pay. Similar to Google, Fb, Uber, Lyft, Stripe etc.

"By far the best working environment I've worked in - and I've worked in other tech companies in Dublin. The company as a whole are committed to their mission and this is reflected in the work that we do daily - from charity work, supporting local (community, food providers) and living our core values. 
Everyone is extremely approachable and friendly and the atmosphere is lovely. The office is dog friendly which is... a huge perk for Dublin, this is not a common perk but it's one we all cherish. We also have an amazing food team who cook us free healthy meals and snacks - no over the top sweets and desserts which in the long run are not ideal. 
The work itself is extremely fast paced and busy, three months work here feels like a years work I've done in previous companies. If you are ambitious and hungry to learn you will love it here. The sky is the limit in terms of what you can get involved in and management are open to hearing new ideas and suggestions. 
Our Founders are extremely present in our day to day roles and we have company meetings with Brian regularly - you really feel like you're all in this together as a team.
Overall highly recommend and very happy to be part of this journey!",1

"The candidate experience from my interview process was absolutely amazing. The number one thing I was looking for in my next opportunity was an engaging and impressive team -- I found just that. In the competitive bay area tech landscape where there are so many promising companies, it's hard to stick out. Airbnb does that by creating meaningful experiences (whether it's the candidate experience, whether it's... wonderful travel experiences, or whether it's the user experience of the website).

Now that I'm here, I continue to be impressed on a daily basis with the multitude of career opportunities, the growth and market potential, and the leaders and coworkers I interact with. 

Airbnb has an amazing company culture and it's something that will be hard for us to lose.",1
"1. You can bring your whole self to work
2. Everyone is extremely respectful, I have never seen so many people hold the door for each other.
3. Gaining work/life balance is encouraged (part of my personal OKRs set by my manager) 
4. Culture is at the forefront of everyone in senior management's mind. Making this a place that is not only profitable but they want you to be able to grow as a person and in your... career.
5. No matter how crazy my day is, there is an INCREDIBLE support system in my coworkers to help me through the day. There isn't a feeling of competition between peers the way that it can be at other companies",1

"This company is like a huge family, where everyone is empowered to make an impact. We work together to champion the mission, embrace the adventure, get work done, and to have fun in and outside of work. It is such an inspiring place to me on a daily basis, and I believe so much in the work we are doing. Brian, Nate and Joe are also some of the most inspiring people I have worked for and they genuinely care about... personal and professional growth. I can say with confidence that this is the best company I have ever worked for...and I spent a long time at Apple and a recruiting startup. My team is very driven but is also really adamant about work/life balance and my manager supports me in my personal and professional goals. I could probably go on and on and on...but I think you get the idea.",1
"Past places I've worked at have really messed up on the culture and Airbnb is the opposite. You can tell the founders care a lot about the company, culture and their colleagues. You can tell people are happy right when you walk in the door. I used to dread Sunday evenings because I would have to go to work and now I look forward to them. 

The hiring process may be a bit slow, but they really do hire well. Everyone here is super nice, smart and hard working. 

Also, because of the fast pace that this company is growing at you get to work on a crazy amount of cool stuff and have a huge impact.",1
"Airbnb creates an amazing workplace culture.

Nothing is perfect, and if it is it becomes obsolete. Yet somehow this place is able to evolve at a pace that is unbelievable that is... close to perfection. Yes as a company there are things it needs to improve, but overall it is a place to expand your creativity and apply your skills. 

The culture is paramount. If you want to work here, bring a solid attitude and let your work speak for itself.

Many changes I see are actively happening with Airbnb, in the positive light. I really enjoy how this company is geared to positive customer service experience. The team I am currently working with is very positive! No one is the same, we are all unique and embrace each other's strengths and build on the weaknesses. Airbnb has done a FANTASTIC job allowing their employees to be themselves ( acceptance, and not judging). I will do an update Review in about three months.",1

Being able to work remotely was a major plus for me, although this applies less and less in today's Airbnb",1

-The ability to work from home from your first day of employment (if you're in a remote position, but even the SF-based employees can work from home one day a week).
-depending on your job, a new Airbook laptop for your... use

"I've been working at Allstate for 4 years as of this review. Overall, Allstate is a good company to work for. The company itself treats everyone well and you feel as if they care about their employees. A lot of long tenured employees that have moved around or up the ladder. 

I just caution due to the size of the company, to make sure you find a role that works for your needs. When it comes to... development/engineering roles, there are definitely some interesting products being produced, with teams using new technologies. Make sure you know what the role entails and ask lots of questions to make sure it is what you want. Some teams use XP paired programming with no opportunity to work remotely, which might not be appealing to all. 

The Merchandise Mart office (not my office) is a fairly new space and is very modern, youthful, and energetic. It has a completely different vibe and culture than the Northbrook office. 

My area is very accommodating when it comes to work/life balance. Everyone generally is able to work from home once a week, more if necessary. If you need to leave early or have personal issues to deal with, management is very understanding. This may not be the case in other areas.",1

"Some background on the company structure--there's the home office located in Northbrook, and then there are regional offices. These offices are split into the """"region"""" side, which houses corporate employees, and the """"field"""" side, which houses claims employees. Agents are not employees of Allstate but independent contractors. An agent's staff is their employee and theirs alone. My experience was with a regional... office as a corporate employee. 

1. The people are extremely friendly--your co-workers truly want you to succeed and it does seem like they have an open cubicle policy; you're free to stop by and converse with co-workers in different departments and it's a common thing for people to stop by your desk.
2. People are REALLY dedicated to Allstate--there were employees working with me that had been at Allstate for 20+ years. You can tell that they were in it for the long haul, and it made me want to stay there for as long as possible. 
3. Like many companies these days, they had small office wide contests or quarterly meetings in which we could win prizes or rewards like gift cards, pizza days, etc. 
4. Dress was pretty casual 
5. Benefits were alright
6. The salary information was pretty easy to figure out--the information is available to all employees on the internal company homepage. 
7. Every young employee in the regional office is given a mentor.",1

For individuals that want to branch outside of their college majors, the LDP program is a great way to do that as it allows you to work in three different areas of responsibility over the course of three years and work experience is not required to work in different departments.

"Everything in this company is of average/below sub-par quality, be it the product quality, office environment or innovation. The bureaucracy is so deep-rooted the company functions more like Indian government PSU rather than an MNC. You'll find a plethora of inept people with 10-15+ years of experience in Amdocs.
Worked with Amdocs for almost 20 months as a Software engineer and here are some of my personal reviews... about the company.
Pros:
- Pune office is located in Magarpatta which is one of the best places to live in India, much better than any other metro Indian cities.
- If you are lucky you will get a chance for an onsite stint, maximum for 2 months. Beware though, you will have to work 6 days a week with 14+ hours each day in such scenarios.
- If you have a zeal to learn and innovate you will find plenty of support from your managers/seniors, but there is a high chance they will steal away your credit, so act smart and beware.
- Work life balance in India is good, work is easy and you won't have to stretch mandatory 9 hours every day, the only people that complain about long work hours are usually incompetent or company slaves trying to work too hard just to impress managers - BTW, it doesn't work.
- Free food; although you will eventually grow over it, and it won't entice you after some time.
- Good colleagues, made some lifelong friends here, amazing people.
- Good leadership overall, You will work """"with"""" some of the amazing managers or work """"under"""" some incompetent ones. But hey! that's the story of every other organization.
- It's a product-base company catering multiple accounts/clients, with its own R&D division, Support division and Sales division each acting as a separate organization from within. Hence you will be exposed to all sorts of work cultures.",1

"I was associated with amdocs for 6 years and I am writing this review after couple of months of me leaving Amdocs. This review is specific to Amdocs Pune development center (DVCI).

The Pros:-

1. Good global exposure - you usually work with teams located in different country. Clients are spread all over the world. Work technologies includes Java, J2EE, UI, Hadoop etc. 

2. Transport Serivces - its paid service for around 1600 PM but is timely and very deciplined. Cabs are also available.

3. Food Services - food is subsidiced, you get a meal of around Rs130 for Rs30. Great options for meals from mulitple vendors. Also 24x7 counter available. 

4. Work Premise - Clean and of international standards. Frequently visited by employees from other countries, clients and vendors.

5. Small Onsite - you can get onsite exposure very quickly (some have travelled within a month of joining). It could also be frequenct but all depends on project and account(client) you get to work for.

6. Longterm Onsite - You need to be lucky here (its not on merit but based on current project circumstances)

7. Social Events - Once a while there is team events like dinner or lunch outside. Also they got Kabala party on most fridays which is kind of small feast.",1

* Challenging, meaningful work
* Fair base compensation
* Strong, substantial bonus opportunities
* Collegial environment
* Approachable management (for the most part)
* Very flexible work options
* Strong degree of autonomy
* Good benefits",1
"Great people to work with.  Company car, cell phone allowance, bonuses for obtaining your licenses even if you already have them, Amex expense card and gas card.  AF does care about its employees.  Working with school districts means you work more of a teachers schedule.  When they are not in session that means you have a lot of down time/family time.  Jan-Mar and June-July tend to be the slower months.  You will... need to be proactive and work your accounts to create opportunities in those months.  The fall is extremely busy which is where most of your opportunities for commission will occur.  March starts to pick up and should stay busy through May for open enrollments.  Those who say there are poor or bad accounts are the ones who expect things to be given to them.  You will get out what you put into it.  You will succeed or fail by your own efforts.  Take advantage of every opportunity even the so called bad accounts, build the relationships with the employees while you are there and don't accept mediocre and you will succeed as long as you are doing whats in the best interest for the client.  This can be a very rewarding career for the person with the willingness, desire ,  drive and mentality to succeed.",1
"Great company to work for. Culture is great and is getting younger as the older guard continues to retire. The company past is quickening.",1
"Benefits are robust and affordable. AFA is a supplemental insurance company, so add-on insurance options like disability, cancer, and AD&D are incredibly cheap. The corporate office also has an on-site gym for $10 a month and a cafe.  Senior leadership is talented, accessible, and down-to-earth.  There are formal mentoring programs, a well-staffed and motivated internal training group, and a wealth of... institutional knowledge to draw from. There's a reason employee retention here is insanely good, with a huge portion of its workforce having tenures of 20 years or more - it's a really good place to work, with a culture and ethos that's easy to support and get behind.",1
"Great compensation, work from home opportunities, everyone’s cares about the work they are doing",1
"Opportunity, rapidly turning into an data driven environment",1
"Culture and perks are the biggest pros. """"Dress for your day"""" is wonderful, and things like the gym, cafe, insurance, 401(k) are great. The defined-benefit pension is especially rare but welcome. The company is extraordinarily stable, with management seeming to prefer stable, sustainable growth over short-term gains as is common with publicly-traded companies. The longevity here is unreal, with many employees having... tenures of 20-30 years, and there is a reason for it.",1
"A great place to work, if you aren't  in the call center.",1
"Compensation, Benefits, perks, pension, immeasurable family culture, surprisingly pro work/life balance, new work environment, top food service with subsidized food costs for healthy choices, on-site amenities, location, cross-divisional participation - Lean, Six Sigma, etc., emphasis on continuous improvement, personal improvement focus",1
"During the interview the questions we technical and I got to show what I knew.

"People at American Fidelity are very kind and they respect each and everyone. The location is perfect for people who wants to work in the downtown.",1
"This is an honest company. Everything I was told right from the start has been true and has come to fruition. Management has always been forthcoming, not just with positives, but with challenges. After more than three years, I am exactly where I thought I would be and as long as I strive to be the best account manager I can be, the opportunities keep coming. Salary is nice, especially after a few years, it increases... every year if you're doing your job. I have found the work/life balance to be AWESOME...and I'm a person who voluntarily travels any time they ask. the fact that you may travel during the week, but are home every weekend and throughout much of the entire summer is great. Car is awesome, especially with the gas card. Everything is paid for you - travel, supplies, cell phone allowance. But besides excellent benefits and financial opportunity, the best part of this job is the team you will work with. I have made some of my best friends on the Ohio team. The teamwork aspect starts at the top - if you have questions or need help, you always feel free to call the company's top sales people and they treat you like gold. The team is great, management is great, and the company overall is a great place to work. If you like a company that cares about its employees, look at AFA!",1
"In past careers, I loved the thrill and income potential of sales but hated the cold calling, unrealistic quotas, and the stinginess of management when it came to things I needed to sell.  American Fidelity is literallly my dream career--salary, car, no cold-calling, made 100k my first full year and increased ever since.  Anyone who likes educating the educators and who likes sales at all would be crazy not to beg... for a position with American Fidelity!",1

"Flexibility, independence, great pay, enjoyable work.  Management does not micromanage and as long as you do a good job you are left alone.  Great incentive trips to places like Monaco, Mexico, Portugal, Hong Kong, Banff, Hawaii, etc.  Defined benefit pension plan plus 401(k) match (up to 6.5% company contribution).  AFA has been great to me and my family!",1
"Health benefits are very good.",1
"Within the IT department the managers are flexible with your time as long as you perform well.  If works falls behind they will pull back on the flexibility (which is warranted).  Cafeteria on site, on site physician's assistant, onsite fitness center with many programs to choose from.  They have fun a few times a year, once they brought in several blow up sets (obstacle course, laser tag, slam dunk challenge),... always something to look forward to.  Most management is very approachable.  They do not keep you on old hardware for too long.  They are currently redoing a lot of the cubicle layouts for better lighting and communication of teams.  Also, currently in a large push toward newer technologies.  Good internal training on non-IT related subjects.  Corporate is conservative with finances, we still had a comparable bonus even through this economic downturn.",1

"Amgen is situated in Thousand Oaks outside of Los Angeles in a very family oriented area. It is surrounded by nature and offers ample opportunity to go hiking in the hills. Lots of nature nearby. But also is at high risk when the wildfires start, like just recently. Many Amgen employees were evacuated from their homes - the fires were that close. The benefits  are excellent - vacation and 401k contribution are among... the best in the industry and make leaving difficult - there are not many alternatives in the area and , considering some of the cons, the golden handcuffs keep retention rates artificially high.

"-Job security (Layoffs for FTers are unheard of, PTers may lose a few hours during slow seasons but will never be terminated over it.)
-You can work your way up from part time cashier to store manager in less than 10 years with zero outside education or experience if you really apply yourself. It's not a glamorous job that will make you rich, but you can make a decent living if you're willing to put in the effort.
-Most stores are a fairly small unit(less than say, 15 or 20 employees is common), so even as just a young sales manager you play a big role in keeping the place up and running. It can be tough, but it is a great experience professionally speaking to be so involved early on.
-Free ASE certification tests!
-Lots of locations (over 5000 now!) and most of them are open 364 days a year and 12 to 15 hours a day, so you can always work out a schedule for any life style. For example I held a FT position, working 40 to 50 hours a week while simultaneously going to college full time and it was never a big deal. PTers who want extra hours can easily put in shifts at other stores in the area to bolster their pay and build professional contacts within the company to help them move up the ladder. 
-A surprising number of very cool coworkers and customers. At least in my area, any shift was always worth at least a few good laughs and a couple of interesting stories. 
-You learn a staggering amount for an entry/low level job. You're doing everything from diagnosing customer's automobile problems, to using multiple computer systems, to inventory control, to installing car batteries/wipers/light bulbs, to resolving employee conflicts, to cashiering, to scheduling, to upselling and moving product, to cash management, to paperwork, to conference calls, to reseting shelving and layouts, to cleaning, to delivering parts, to stocking, to ordering, to training new employees. The list goes on, and there's always new stuff happening. You deal with everyone from experienced shade tree mechanics, to Joe Schmo, to Joe Schmo's wife, to the clueless, to commercial accounts with local shops, to your 6 figure salaried upper management. You will truly be put through your paces here. 
-After putting in 5 years here, I went from clueless highschooler to seasoned parts professional. I can look at a set of used brake pads for example and instantly know everything there is to know about your entire brake system. I never need a mechanic anymore, I fix my friends' cars on the side, plus I have an endless database in my head of information of all sorts about nearly every make and model of car made in the last 2 or 3 decades. Ignore all of the complainers on here; all of the tools you need to succeed are right in front of you at AutoZone, but as they say, """"You can lead a horse to water, but you can't make it drink.""""

If you have previous mechanical experience, i.e., professional or at home, you will really shine.  DIY customers appreciate accurate advice to help them with their vehicle problems, and I get great personal satisfaction when a customer sincerely says, thank you.  (This makes up for the low pay—see below....)
 A career ladder is in place for hard workers.  Store, district, regional mangers, vice presidents, and CEO all got promoted from within.   
Yes, this is retail.  Sales are what pay the bills, salaries, and stock holders.  Every level of management is encouraged to increase sales.  One must accept that concept, or you will not be happy.  Just follow the AZ method of WOWing the customer and sales will increase.  WOW customer service is what makes AutoZone different from the competition.  Employees are encouraged to: GOTTCHA (Go Out To The Customers Automobile) and take a look at the problem, and WITTDTJR (What It Takes To Do The Job Right) in order to sell all of the related parts necessary to complete the repair the first time--without having to make a second, or more, trip to the parts store for additional or forgotten items.",1

I have a long commute, only to sit in a seat all day (with distractions), while doing independent work with other 3M locations. The stress, money and time away from my kids is not needed.

Second, and this is so easily fixable, there is not enough value placed on education, especially in the Underwriting department.   In fact, they are continuously reducing the education benefits they give. Comparable companies are paying for CPCU materials up front, and Acuity is not.  Comparable companies give raises and days off for tests... passed, and Acuity does not. Comparable companies are paying for a guest to go on the CPCU trip, and Acuity recently took that away.

I was lucky that I had previous calling experience, so I didn't do too badly; however the compensation was solely commission and despite my many appointments, I didn't get paid for my work until after the internship had ended. I had to work at my internship full time and work at a restaurant on the weekends just so that I could pay for gas. Aflac does not give you any compensation for business expenses. I paid for all of my own gas, tolls, and stamps and I had to use my own cell phone when calling businesses. I was also misled about the compensation system. I was under the impression that I was a W2 employee, when in fact I was a 1099 employee. At the age of 19, I ended up owing the government over $800 in taxes. Had I known this was a possibility, I would have never taking the job. WORST of all was what happened after my internship had ended. Aflac has a policy that requires employees to give back their commission if people cancel their accounts before a year has gone by. I was NEVER informed of this and over a year after I left the company I got a statement saying that I owed the company $300 with absolutely no explanation as to why I was being charged. I called over and over again until I finally found someone who even knew what the charge was for. I was treated like I was an idiot and was not taken seriously by anyone even after I had explained the situation. I did not have the $300 at the time and after months of trying to get the charge reduced or taken away, I finally gave up and borrowed the money from my parents. I contacted the Aflac ethics department explaining what had happened and how unfairly I had been treated and I never got a response. This was by far the worst job I've ever had.

At Aflac you get about 13 days off a year (not including holidays which is a plus) and if an emergency comes up and you go over those days or you use up your 40 hours of unscheduled PTO you will get written up and... are at risk for termination.  I have seen alot of good people get fired because of going over their days.  Not a good company to work for if you have children because you basically have to plan on when they will get sick and having your time approved to be out with them. No room for growth.  It seems that getting promotions is based on """"It's not what you know, but who you know.""""  Some of the supervisors help their favorites that have not been there long get the promotions and raises while the ones that really deserve it and have been there for years stay in the same position.

Equipment. Aflac has you use their own laptops for presentations and enrollments and they finance... one for you when you've made enough money. However, until that point you need to get one form either a supervisor or another agent, which has been a real problem in my office.

Broken operation - I have been working for several tech companies big and small, the management at Airbnb is definitely on the chaotic side.  Teams step on each others’ toes, nonsense frequent reorganization, people get promoted by taking others’ credit. Mid management  focus on growing their own career here rather than helping  team or their reports be successful. Setting up your authority in the organization or being an early employee is more important than doing actual impactful work. Many managers promoted within the company from early days do not know how to manage and often meddle with employee’s work.

Lack of innovation - most of middle management here, as a result of trying to promote their own career, do not take bold innovative approach to the business. The result is a lack of innovation to make impact but rather fine tuning to make their performance review looks good or please their upper management.

It gives those that are proactive and interested in having an impact on how Airbnb does things, a lot of opportunity, but it's... admittedly not for everyone. Some may find it a bit chaotic.

"I am leaving this rating as a former LDU adjuster and someone who has a graduate degree. The workload is VERY heavy. You can walk in on a Monday as a liability adjuster and have 40+ voicemails and 6+ new claims with 30 pending. They require you to only have 10 pending liability and to call back on ALL voicemails. They expect you to make contact with both drivers involved in the accidents on the same day the claim is... filed, which is good except they require it even on the claims you receive on Saturday and Sunday. This leaves everyone at a disadvantage. They reward years of loyalty by increasing workload and not increasing salary. Some of the management is also old fashioned and out of style to today's work/life balance requests. If you want to work 60+ hours a week and still not complete everything, then this job is for you. Do not expect to leave on time. 

In regards to claims processing, it is a fantastic job. We are allowed the freedom of a work/life balance and do not have the stresses of the adjusters. Essentially our duty is to help the adjusters and lighten their load. We take inquiry calls, order police reports, open needed coverage, and assure everything is working well on the back end of the claim. It is a lot of behind the scenes work with more data entry and I love it. 

Beware, the company just had us all sign an arbitration agreement and put a cap on PTO, which, in my opinion is going backwards in innovation compared to what newer companies are offering. 

Also, zero movement upwards in the OKC office. If you are willing to move you can go far, but not here.",0

"From what I can tell, Allstate's base pay isn't the best. It's probably right in line with averages, maybe a little lower than others. Benefits are just okay, but there is a pension plan here  that they put a little money in.

I've heard of many people moving around over the years to different roles, but I've had a problem doing the same in the last year. There's a big effort to move IT roles to other locations... across the US, with some teams relocating, leaving employees to face the decision of relocating to keep their job. Due to this, there is not as much is available in Illinois. 

A lot of this will change depending on where you are in the company. Office location, role, organization, etc. I happen to be on a team supporting a legacy application. So, as a developer, it's not the most exciting and there's not much day-to-day development work. It's also a fairly older area, age-wise. If you would prefer a younger crowd, stick with jobs in the mart or in the lab in Northbrook South plaza.

Speaking of the office in Northbrook, it's pretty large with 4 buildings, 3 on campus and 1 across the street. Due to the aforementioned move to different states, the 2 acquired buildings will be shut down. So it will be back down to the 2 original buildings. To accommodate the amount of people, cubicles are being broken down into open seating. Also, the design and decoration of the office is pretty standard with lots of grey and neutral colors with the occasional brightly colored wall.

"This company loves to tout their advancement opportunities and used that allure to draw me from another company.  In reality,  if you are not well known at Home Office, you will be passed over for a less qualified candidate that the hiring manager already knows. This company has an extremely strong """"kool aid"""" mentality particularly since the implementation of their Continuous Improvement (C.I.) program (think Agile, it's pretty much the same structure with a different name). The C.I. model is cumbersome to claims adjusters who are already overburdened by high case loads and high office turnover but upper level management repeatedly ignores these concerns on the surveys that they insist you fill out. Their quality standards are a setup to fail - seasoned adjusters with awesome files were still falling short and this was used against them when annual compensation discussions took place.

The real rub for me was Allstate's Injury Evaluation Program (I.E.P.). You will quickly note that Allstate speaks entirely in proprietary acronyms and never wants their employees to mention them to outsiders. I.E.P. involves short changing claimants on medical bill reimbursement in states where there is no legal precedent to do so (i.e. a state with a Collateral Source rule requires that you reimburse to full bill, not just what was paid - if you're uninsured,  Allstate will run your bill through their proprietary bill review software to come up with an extremely low ball payment and force you to litigate if you disagree). Also Colossus is very much alive and well and very much a low ball program. I don't even know why they call Allstate employees adjusters. We had no authority to decide anything and for that matter, neither did management.

Allstate recently laid off about 7-800 employees in the Auto department as many things have transitioned to being virtual. The layoffs were not done professionally and shows how little Allstate values their employees. Not sure if there were will be any layoffs in claims but there is talk about it.

"Nice guy (from pros above), but new to insurance, starting from scratch (did not buy a book of business) and not motivated to network in community. Also had to ride him about two days of pay that was missing from first two checks, the education bonus he promised (was glad I had that in writing) and don't think he ever did reimburse co-worker for business lunches, donuts for brokers or mileage. A bit slimy (feeds in... to insurance agent stereotype!)

Our regional support staff was horrific! They'd show up occasional, eyes glazed over (stepford like) spouting their mantra-""""cold call - at least 50 a day per person."""" One guy told me, when he was an agent, he would call until the prospect told him """"to go to hell!"""" (No wonder he's not an agent anymore and Allstate's name is tarnished). (He's also the one that intentionally misstates info in app for better rates...sure that helps loss ratios!)

Our other support person doesn't remember you from one visit to the next and has never been an agent...she's frazzled, tired, trying to hold on until she can retire...basically, she's worthless.

We got rammed through licensing and training to meet specific dates so the agency could open on appointed date. No pay for hours of online training (and major headaches with IT getting home PCs compliant enough to do training as office wasn't open yet.) Did an extra, very repetitive session on Life and we can't even sell it ourselves-we have to refer to special Life agent! 

Tons of typos in training materials and some elements did not work at all. The webinars we received after in office (some mandatory/some elective) are the worse I've ever seen in my 25 years in business! It's apparent they are reading a script- a poorly written one at that, with conflicting and confusing information. And, worse of all, the presenters are completely unable to answer participant questions. Some did not mute callers so was distracted during entire presentation (mostly by people leaving call!)

On site training in Lone Tree, CO wasn't much better. Basically cold calling all day. One day (of 3 day training) no instructor (task master) even bothered showing up!
Majority of 3 day trainings do not provide hotel accommodations - they expect you to drive back and forth each day (4 hour commute for our office...without any traffic, weather, accidents!) and provide no compensation for mileage.

Trying to get regional help with policy issues /questions is a joke. One regional employee actually hung up on a co-worker who was trying to resolve a roofing issue for a new client (they had replaced roof after inspection/pending cancellation-he was trying to get info in system to stop cancellation and was having issues w systems). No training in place for endorsements/issues such as this and systems are not intuitive. 

Aren't enough reasons to sell Allstate - the only price advantage for vast majority of insureds are those with new houses and brand new roofs. Weren't usually competitive in any other area. Claims satisfaction guarantee, deductible rewards, accident forgiveness, cash back....don't mean much up front, especially since you pay more to get them with no guarantee that they'll  ever pay off. And don't get me started on Commercial insurance - it's pathetic!

Insurance is still about the bottom line premium for majority of consumers... if you can get them to talk about it! I swear, more people will talk to you about death and taxes....they don't understand and hate insurance!

Spent my days staring at the phone...cold calling...which felt like throwing spaghetti at the walls all day....spaghetti that wasn't cooked! Calling during business hours is a waste - the types of clients you want are working then! And those that called us or walked in were scary....living in half way houses, wanting insurance with drivers permit only, SR22's....lovely.

And, of course, the clincher.... Allstate does not offer agents any insurance benefits despite being in the business of selling them! You are contact....all the work, no benefits beyond commissions.... which are meager carrots that you can only get once you jump through hoop after hoop (with no guidance or real training!)

Go elsewhere....independent agency perhaps. Trust me, you'll be glad you did!",0

They have an 8week in class training leading up to a 3 day 8hr long each day """"test"""" they give in which they tell you oh it does not matter the score you get on the test-is just to gauge where you are at--again not true--they will also never let you know or see the score you get on the test--but if you do not score where they think you should be--and again this is never clearly communicated either--you will find yourself put on an """"action plan""""-again keep in mind all through training they are pushing so much information at you it is ridiculous to remember it all--they call it """"download""""-all the while they keep telling you not to worry, they don't expect you to remember it all--again this is not true-so after the classroom part and test is over-everyone is assigned their """"Mentor""""  and you are taking real work by this time--""""receipts"""" as they call them  --is basically any customer,consumer, or agency complaints that come in-because this is what you will be doing is handling complaints--ok so you have your """"Mentor"""" and I have to say there are some good ones that are not fake and truly have an interest in you succeeding-unfortunately my experience with my """"mentor"""" was not that-at first he was oh too willing to help-again FAKE! I thought at first hey he is great, knowledgeable,and really wants me to succeed. Oh I was so very mistaken. He would not know the answers himself, give me the wrong answers, then later deny that he told me the wrong info. and any so called help that was given --will be used against you later on--I truly feel if I had another mentor my experience at Allstate would have been way different-He did not like me and was determined to get me out-and was friends with my manager that I went to after training.  She was a new manager and again a reoccurring theme with this place is FAKE!! Smile in your face while talking to others behind your back. So if you are considering Allstate, you may want to think long and hard if it is the Customer Resolution Specialist position-the work is not rewarding-you basically have people complaining and they usually have every right to-but in this role a great deal of the time you are telling them oh sorry, there is nothing I can do! Bottom line this job role at Allstate is a stinker in a horrible high school like office environment where alot of the people are just fake-I guess it may be that  they have spent so much time being fake with their customers. It pays 15.25 an hour-way too little to put up with all that--would be better off anywhere else!! Good luck!",0

"The company’s compliance with the FLSA overtime rules have been a nightmare for new hires and employees with only a few years of tenure. Essentially, Allstate recently classified employees below a certain salary band as non-exempt. This means that they’re restricted to a 40-hour workweek. 

The problem is that the company never revised the production or quality goals for non-exempt employees. We’re still expected... to do the exact same work, in the exact same amount, and at the exact same quality levels, as exempt employees who are free to work overtime to complete their assigned tasks. Realistically, very few claims employees are able to complete their assigned work in 40-hour week. Good luck reaching the production and quality goals the company sets forth if you’re non-exempt. 

Raises, promotions, and, in some cases, job security, are directly tied to the amount, the quality of work, and (historically) tenure with the company. This makes non-exempt, relatively new employees significantly less competitive than exempt employees, even though they're doing the exact same job in many cases. If you’re new, expect small raises to uncompetitive pay rates, limited chances of advancement. This is all because the company doesn't allow you the resources necessary to complete your goals. 

In addition, non-exempt employees recently lost the ability to telecommute. As of 2017, the company only offers high-deductible health plans. Don’t break your leg unless you’re joining with a fully funded HSA or are independently wealthy. Vacation scheduling is based on seniority. In subrogation, only 20% of employees can take PTO on any given day, including Thanksgiving and Christmas/Hanukkah.  Good luck spending any holiday with your family unless you’ve had 20+ years with the company, especially if they live far away.",0

"1. Global Competition and Outsourcing: We live in a very well connected world. Every body in any corner of the world is well connected with each other through emails, messengers etc. There is great IT workforce in India which can do the same job in less money as compared to the developers in USA and Europe. Almost every IT company outsources its lot of work to India to reap benefits by utilising the talent of India... and saves a lot of money. So, the competition in this field is global and you have to be very perfect to cope this.

2. You have to upgrade your skills continuously: Technology is changing every day. Everyday, there are new enhancements, everyday there is new invention. You have to keep yourself very active and updated otherwise you will be left behind in the race. You have to learn new thing everyday. You should learn to adapt with new things. Standing rigid with the old things will make you lose the competition. Keep on learning new programming languages and always add new thing to your resume.

3. Sitting Job: You have to sit tight to your desk and stare at your computer continuously. If this is not fine for you, you should not come to this profession. But today, other jobs are also becoming like this. So you will find this kind of scenario in each and every job. It can make you unhealthy very easily.

4. Age Discrimination: There is a lot of age discrimination in the software programming field. Many people think that a person above 40 would not be able to perform well. Preference is given to the young developers because it is assumed that they have fresh mind and would be able to solve the programming puzzles and tricks easily as compared to the old brains. Also young developers will cost less to the companies.

5. Long hours, Tight deadlines and no personal and social life: In IT field, you are bound to the tight deadlines and have to work for long hours and on weekends to meet the deadlines. Most of the Software developers have to sacrifice their personal and social life to make the deliveries on time.",0

They get away with it so the rest of the company suffers immensely.  You can kiss raises... and fun good bye unless it comes from corporate relations - merely cupcakes!!!  Really....they are at the beck and call of the US and the current president is a puppet that is loved by Canada and the US because of the profits.

There is 0 positive incentive and management only acknowledges negative criticism.

I've seen dedicated employees with 15-25 years of service thrown to the curb, only to be replaced by a 20-something with barely any experience.  It's sickening!",0

Your peers, those who are also entry level, are usually hostile and easily threatend. They will step on you and stab you in the back without hesitation. They will lie and cheat just to get you introuble. Perhaps they hope they can get ahead.

In IT moral is extrmemley low. Everyone is terrified of being fired. They will openly discuss their discontent. Usually the unrealistic goals bother them the... most. Those who are good or have been insulted enough have already left. 

Managers lead by intimidation. They are unapproachable and fail to attend their own meetings. 

Allstate screams diversity and continuous improvement, yet Any attempt to question a methd or present an idea to improve is met with anger and being told you have no right to speak. 

So much red tape, any attempt to improve or change is blocked. Innovation is impossible

Managers will ignore you and fail to follow up with you or help you. The recent reorgs have caused the managers to handle 3 or more jobs. Not only are they stressed, but they ignore everyone. Clearly good managers are leaving.

You are expected to work extensive hours with no flex days. Any attempt to go around this is met with threats and intimidation.

 I am treated like an intern. Projects are jokes and are clearly run aways. My only work is busy work. What is most insulting is you clearly know all this, and yet they pretend like it is the most important thing. 

If it wasnt for the pay, id have already left.",0

"P.C. agents have new financial producers introduced to them almost every week.  You are told you can work with as many different P.C. agents as you like, but due to jaded agents (high turnover of financial reps), good luck getting any business referred to you.  Two or three financial guys get 95% of all the business.  It is VERY hard to get referrals.  So, you are basically doing all your own production at half the... comp. you would earn if you were independent.  
In addition, just because someone has general liability insurance doesn't mean there are good candidates for life, disability, long-term care or financial services.  Remember you are in a sophisticated business.  Anyone can buy general liability insurance.

Charlotte is pretty much the defacto call center that handles the majority of call flow throughout the country.. Let me repeat that. THE. ENTIRE. COUNTRY. There are two other call centers but they are more so auxiliaries with different roles.. Texas handles outbound and... Idaho.. Well, the verdict is still out on what management wants to do with them considering they're looking at changing a lot of roles there. 

Charlotte is bleeding employees, it's sad. Recent reorganization and focus in operations to satisfy disgruntled agents is backfiring big time and now employees are being tasked to cover up mismanagement by  higher ups and are becoming fatigued. Customer reps are absorbing more duties that were outside their roles. Combine this with Tom Wilson's love of premium increases to enrage customers and you got a recipe for a interesting, if not, wicked interaction between irritated reps and broke customers. Due to the long layover time to train people there's been difficulty in maintaining adequate levels for call handling. Going to work on Saturdays is like walking the Green Mile right into Hades.",0

I'm amazed I'm still allowed to go use the restroom... without approval, but that'll change soon no doubt.  Very weird to see the dramatic shift in the respect (lack of) factor that claims people get.  It's as if management is entirely unconcerned and actually annoyed at ANY feedback we want to share with them.  They seem to be using the economy-based fears to their advantage now, but in the long run it will cost them loyalty from their employees.  And of course, they will again blame the employees for whatever ills the company suffers by management's lack of common sense.   Motivation here is based upon negative reinforcement principles, known for years to be the absolutely least effective and most destructive model a company can possibly use.  Didn't used to be this way, have no idea what dopes have totally altered the entire management style of this company, but whoever they are, THEY need to go so that employees can do their work and be left alone to do it without constant fear of punishment for making mistakes, which have a positive correlation with workload (DUH).  A mistake cannot simply be acknowledged, learned from, and left behind as it should be, it needs to be analyzed by 10 people, reviewed ad nauseum, then presented back to the employee for an explanation.

1. Say goodbye to your Work/Life Balance.
2. Say goodbye to your Family during Christmas, New Year and other holidays as you will need to report onsite (beats the purpose of you having an internet connection at home). It sucks really.
3. Say GOODBYE to your CAREER GOALS and DEVELOPMENT. Say what NEW TECHNOLOGY? LEARNING? NADA. You won't get it here. They won't even invest in you like... certifications and classroom training. Oh yes they have online training videos/tutorilas -believe me its CRAP.
4. You thought the company pays you well? Give it sometime to sink in..and you will realize its not even close to how slave you are to them.
5. They maximize people..BURNOUT is HIGH.
6.  Your slave job is not an 8am to 5pm schedule. You are ONCALL for 24/7. Day-in and day-out. You will get calls as early as 2AM in the morning. And calls even after your shift.
7. Annual Increase you say? -wow 35 USD and below enough for a 24/7 shift?
8. They ask so much of you to support the account even on a weekend. Thus, you are SPOC for a weekend. BUT BEWARE its not considered OT until someone calls you..how CRAPPY is that considering weekend is supposed to be your family day. Worst thing is if the support call lasted for only 45 minutes..that is still not considered OT on a weekend. 
 9. ONLY the """"YES MAN"""", """"SYCOPHANT"""", """"BROWNNOSE""""gets promoted. PERIOD. These department bosses/heads will get ALL the credit from your team's hardwork because they are the ones recognized/reporting to top management. You will literally settle for PENNIES.

     During my employment I had clients requesting me continuously and was constantly being commended for my team building abilities.  
     Whenever there was a fire because the project was in the weeds; they would pull me over to get project settled in order to meet the launch date. 
     TO MY GREATEST SURPRISE..... when going to re enter work field and beginning to reconnect with old colleges that wanted me back on their team; we were told that my file had been stamped with NO RE HIRE !!!

Limited Onsite opportunity",0
"If you work there for more than 7 years you start seeing your bonuses and your pay increases start going down.
Each year there is a “silent” layoffs, you never know if you are the own next or not.
There is very little planning and communication from the BU to BU specifically IT.
If you’re in the Americas get ready to be a “just do it” person, they don’t need someone to solve problems.
Management is completely... clueless from the top down.  They have no idea what it really takes to make the company run, all they care about is their bonus they get quarterly and yearly.  So however they can increase their pockets is the better.  
The teams run so lean that when there is a problem or someone goes on vacation you are forced into situations to be a firefighter.
If you are a skilled employee with much knowledge that has been there for a while it seems they want you to go.",0
"Work in different shifts and some off-time client calls",0
"Amdocs is a large company with multiple divisions and I feel as though those divisions are not integrated as well as they could be. Cross training across the divisions would be beneficial in selling services.",0
"No vertical growth, poop compensation",0
"Less payer than market, Few people get frequent onsite while some get none (totally luck based, nothing related to performance)",0
"The hours can become long, but you can work from anywhere. During busy season some people show up around 9am and work until 9pm, while others work 7-7pm depending on your preference. Of course, your schedule depends on the clients to which you're assigned.",0
"Nothing much, Here things looks good",0
"I spent 4 years in the company and kept seeing it spiral downwards. It just kept going from bad to worse.
1. No technical growth
2. Below par salaries. The salary given to campus selected fresher in 2004 = 3.5Lakhs/annum. Salary given to fresher 2013=3.2Lakhs/annum.
3. Random figure to calculate iteration. They say low iteration, but you never seem to see the same faces again. Someone from HR once told us how... they calculate iteration which made no sense as they said the iteration numbers were low because of larger hiring numbers. 
4. Recruit people by saying for development and then move them to support/non-dox products.
5. Even in development team, there is no real development work going on. They have a product ready. The product design and development does not happen in India. Here, we mostly tweak existing stuff to customer requirements.
6. If you are lucky, then you might get to be on a decent project. If you are on a new or """"upcoming"""" project then you will be spending 14 hrs in office and wont get weekends. 
7. Idea of compensation and support is absurd. Its set up by managers and HR who do not wish to give any money or extra leaves to the employee. The rule is if you work on saturday for 9 hrs then you will get the number of hours worked on sunday as compoff. So managers either call you to work only on saturdays and make you stay til the work is done, usually 12 to 15 hrs or you are on """"on-call"""" support. Which means you will need to work only if you get a call, which will invariable come and so you cannot leave home. But you should only write the hours you worked exactly. So you endup losing your day to office with out any benefit.
8. The management changed hands in 2010. Since then the new managements idea for India center is : India is very big in the service sector with low pay. So we should try to get all the work that we can get for the service part of the company. Since Asia is a very big market, so we can do a lot here. May be good idea on paper, but this was valid maybe in 1990's. Now Indian market is a lot higher paying and so the basic premise is faulty. The upper management does not have an idea of what the company product is about. They make absurd and illogical promises to clients which cannot be kept and then blame developers/support teams for not keeping their word. 
9. Amdocs products are very costly for the Asian Market. Rates that they use outside of India (in developed nations) cannot be used with-in Asia. This is a big bottleneck for them because they need lot of investment to handle the very large customer base with-in Asia but they wont make as much  money out of it. So to keep things on an even profit margin, they need to cut the number of people working on the project, but all commitments need to be kept. 
10. There is an idea of """"Com-managers"""" with in this company. The com-managers are people who will act as bridge between client and technical staff. So they are supposed to act as the go between. They are important to a project as long as a real communication chain needs to exist between client and company. So when cost cutting moves come in, they should be among the first to be booted. They are non-technical and the developer invariably has to communicate to the client on the work being done. So the """"Com"""" needs to make certain that there is enough chaos going on so as to keep his position secure. This was visible in multiple projects that I worked on.
11. If you have worked here a few years (2-4) then you have by then become : a person with lots of Amdocs experience but with zero technical skills because all you use are select/update and ls-lrt commads. Position above GL are management. You can become an SSME in 2 to 2.5 years. GL may take about 6 to 8 based on how good your rapo is with your manager and if he is any good at selling you. Salaries and hikes are based on how """"bell curve"""" on project to project, so to speak. The hike numbers may sound as market average (8% to 15% was the average that they maintained when I was there), but because their sals are on a lower side of market, you will always remain less than market average. And because you have no technical skills to speak off, you cannot get out to another company easily. And because there is no real time to learn anything on your own as well because of expected hours of support, you cannot improve yourself either.
12. Team meetings were funny, where managers would tell us, that people whose project is now stable should start working on making other peoples project out of the goodness of our heart with out any benefits. (HR funda I guess)
13. There is the probability of onsite projects. Thats the carrot which is given to you if you start crying. 
14. There is a core team. They are supposed to be the ones who work on the exact product code. Only the India team once again serves as the support team. All calls for product crash and unexpected behavior come to India and they are supposed to reproduce and fix it. But the actual code development will stay only in Israel.",0

"Amdocs' business model is based on acquisitions: 

So if you work in a company that gets acquired by Amdocs expect the following:

1-  You will slowly but surely have your culture erased and replaced by the Amdocs culture. It's full of red tape and has many layers of bureaucracy. ETA until full culture erase is 3 year. 
2- It's an Israeli based company so expect to have an irritating unprofessional army like... upper management structure.  
3- Only the flagship product will remain (reason for acquisition) all the other projects will be canned and the resources will be re-vectored to the flagship product. 
4- If you're not in India, expect the R&D to slowly move to India. They will start by a small team in India and grow there. 

This will lead to a stop to any creativity and/or new product development, and to a slow move to an Indian heavy R&D organization through normal attrition. 

I recommend to calmly start looking for another job once the acquisition happens, unless you're comfortable with long term stagnation and the occasional unprofessional contact with people from other business units.",0

Corporate used to send out employee satisfaction surveys, and they were so bad that have meetings were started on how to approve morale, then they decided it was just easier to get rid of the people who complained the loudest.  Upper management is incompetent, and tries to micro-manage because they think the problem is the people, when in fact the process structure in Champaign stinks.

"3 downsides of working @ Amdocs
1. If you work in the product management or marketing fields, then beware: one look at the Annual Report (which I recommend you download and read if you're considering a job here) will tell you that we are a very service centric company. Even though we are pushing hard to get our product heritage to market, a vast majority of our revenue comes from customized solutions, and managed... services deals. This makes it very difficult to effectively manage your product in such a service centric environment. Because Amdocs has a track record of always completing a project (Amdocs does most of its implementations), this can de-stabilize product roadmap activities as R&D resources get recommitted to making our customers complex implementations successful. You will have to be able to juggle these priorities, as firedrills will happen. On the other hand, we are known for our successful implementations (unlike an infamous competitor of ours... ;0)
2. Bi-Polarization
A large part of Amdocs' senior management team is based in Israel. This creates almost a nucleus of managerial power. This also sometimes creates a sense of disconnect with the heart of the organization. This can affect some more than others. I suspect that our colleagues based in Australia, India, or South Africa, or even LATAM feel this more than the European and North American offices. You will have to be prepared to travel frequently to Israel to keep your visibility going, and make sure that you can gain traction with your market and product initiatives. The managerial responsibilities are globalizing gradually, so there is signs of improvement here.",0

Poor communication between departments which makes it confusing for the customer.
Too many different departments. If a customer has a Cancer policy, Texas Life, Flex account and Annuity and they want to make a payment and need help submitting a claim that could be potentially 5 different people they end up talking to. After 6 months of being a permanent representative I feel like each person should be crossed trained on an additional product and that should continue every 6 months with a refresher course offered as well. 
Very selective in hiring process. I’ve referred 10, 8 of which have had interviews and have not been hired. All of which have very similar backgrounds to me and I was hired. The application process is difficult as well if you don’t know someone who works for the company.

I did not feel valued and felt like I was just another person in a seat.... I understand the meaning of customer service and understood what it meant to be customer-focused but what about the importance and value of the employee them self?

The rest of the year you will be scratching to make quota with your manager riding your back every step of the way and this is in a developed territory. If you are in an undeveloped or sparsely populated... territory forget it you cannot make quota. The turnover is so high that district managers are constantly on the chopping block for not being able to """"hire right"""" or keep employees.

2) State and regional managers do not hesitate to fault the account reps for their... mismanagement of enrollments. 
3) Favoritism runs rampant. If you are not a favorite of state managers, don't expect to be put on decent enrollments, instead, expect to be sent to another state """"to help out"""" or sent to voluntary enrollments in which one won't make Quota. 
4) Turnover. While working for AF, the state had almost 80% turnover. This angers customers and creates a bad environment for reps who are the """"face"""" of accounts. State managers rarely face retribution from the company for their mismanagement. 
5) Extensive travel in some states. Territorial assignments are often non existent and you will be required to spend many weeks often hours from

"Things have not always been so good.  California had significant challenges around 2009 that affected compensation but this was due mostly to the poor economy.  It can be hard to go to work sometimes with so much freedom so you have to be a real self starter.

No company is perfect but I do... believe AF is one of the best places to work overall.",0
"Confusing/misleading/often changing compensation plan-4 changes to the compensation document in less than three years.  Local management doesn't even understand most recent changes.

Extremely unbalanced workload- 60%+ of accounts need serviced in the 4th quarter.  Management's solution, start your 4th quarter groups in September.  Very unprofessional, and not in keeping with AFA's mantra of being an extension of... a company's HR department.

Blatant favoritism-Worst company I've ever worked for in this regard.  If you are 100% of quota, but not buddies with the district manager, you will not work in the new (and therefore financially lucrative) groups.  Quite the contrary in that account managers with abysmal production (but personal pals with the DM) will be put in the position to enroll these new groups.

Coached to tell customers one thing while actually doing otherwise-We are told to tell everyone we meet that we are salaried account managers, but don't be fooled...this company is commission driven! Even with the lopsided workload you will be expected to be selling 4 out of 5 days a week.  Again this is completely unrealistic.  

Additionally we are coached to tell everyone we are needs based salespeople.  We tell people we are NOT policy pushers, but again once our core benefits (disability and life insurance) are saturated in a group we are expected to come up with an angle to sell our tertiary products like accident, cancer, critical illness, or my favorite riders on existing policies. In this same vein we are coached to present EVERY employee we meet with with a life insurance quote, no financial needs analysis completed (I really don't think most of the employees or especially management would even know what a needs analysis would look like).  This is the very definition under insurance ethics of """"pushing policies""""! 

Unbelievable turnover- One reason I took this job was because of what was described as extremely low turnover.  It was described as less than 5% turnover annually.  Anyone familiar with the insurance industry will recognize this as an extremely low turnover rate.  The reality is that in the last several years I have seen closer to 60-70% turnover both locally as well as nationally.",0

Bonus programs offered to employees are skewed to provide... upper management with the highest percentage.

Continual erosion of salaries and benefits are making the organization ordinary. Amgen's culture is one of blame and shame. Lack of career growth opportunities, the grade level and salary that you join with are both going to stay stagnant... during your employment. Amgen does not promote its people, even more so in Information Services.  If you are an IT person who is career oriented I cannot endorse working for Amgen.  As an IT professional you will have better opportunities elsewhere.

The organization used to be a good stepping stone to learn and train at, however now the opportunities to widen one's knowledge base are few and far between at Amgen. 

Be prepared for excessively long work days - 16 hours is the norm, plus weekends.  As more people leave the ones that stay are expected to take on more and fall to their knees with thanks that  they are employed.  

If you are a contractor be ready to be treated like a second class employee with nothing to offer. Don't even look sideways at a FTE or executive as they will remove you from the account for the most minor infraction, true or not.

There is an acceptance of high levels of business risk across the organization, through IS, Information Security, product production, etc. There is a group-think strategy of running the entire company via Managed Services which I have never seen be successful in my career, and I don't foresee it being successful in this case either.

Budgeting is penny wise and dollar foolish, with current financial processes that are so bureaucratic and antiquated as to be tangible business risk.

"The ag-industry is slow growing, has tiny margins, and doesn’t really change, hence ADM lacks a dynamic atmosphere, and more resembles an inefficient government bureaucracy. When you also consider that most CFO-group jobs are in Decatur, Il (a polluted, rundown industrial town), this leads to several negative factors:

-Minimal career development. They don’t develop their own employees, so most senior-level... employees are recruited from competitors who DO develop employees.

-Low pay. Only top managers are eligible for any form of bonus. Salary is known to be far below industry standard.

-Ancient IT systems, think 1980’s DOS system. Seriously. ADM isn’t Apple.

-Brain-drain/less qualified employees. No qualified person really wants to live in Decatur. The 'leftovers' are more focused their multiple out of wedlock children and the Kardashians. 

-Nepotism. It’s amazing how many people have a relative that were ‘helped.’ Many many people have the same last names, and not by coincidence.

 Simply put, the CFO group is not for intelligent, hardworking and career-minded individuals. To further attest to ADM’s status, there have been several recent high profile departures, including the head of IT, while in the middle of a huge IT transformation project. The C-suite routinely brags about its high-margin acquisition strategy, but no tiny bolt-on purchase will really ad that much value when compared to ADM’s behemoth corn/oilseeds/grain divisions.
The CFO group at ADM is a place to go for a job, for a paycheck. If you are ambitious, or want at least moderate career development, AVOID any finance/accounting job at ADM. If you are interested in a merchandising role, then ADM is definitely the right place.",0

Management doesn't want to listen to you when you tell them that there's a problem, but when that problem gets out of hand and stops... production it's the employee's fault. Safety only matters if it won't cost anything to do. If there's a problem with the tracks, and you tell your supervisor, he tells you he'll pass it up the line but keep using that track. When you keep using the track and cars derail, it's your fault because your supervisor never passed it up to management. Communication is non existent. When the superintendent comes out of his office, he doesn't know what anything is or where anything is. He will also yell at you for doing something wrong, when he doesn't know if it's wrong or right in the first place. If you take your concerns higher than him, that he doesn't know what is going on, they tell you not to worry about it. It's a very discouraging system.",0

"My number one pet peeve is the operating systems that AutoZone uses, it is a new and constant battle everyday to help customers by utilizing the operating systems. The GUI is great, but the rest of it is mostly crud, countless dead hyperlinks, overzealous restrictions that make it difficult to use the system, and redundant/useless data. AutoZone doesn't have enough servers which causes huge amounts of latency... therefore causing transactions an such to timeout. The server centers do not have backup generators/systems which halt any digital interface usage between employee/customer. From what I can gather the operating systems have remained more or less the same from decades ago, with frequent patches (band-aids) to keep the systems running. Huge amounts of time and efficiency, which equals money, are lost to these problems alone. The store I work at doesn't use modern high speed internet, it uses old school two wire DSL. I'm indescribably frustrated by cell phone usage excluding store and commercial manager, it's too much of a distraction.

CEO complains of having less profit due to """"demand for higher wages"""".  Raises (once per year) at my store that consistently hit or was very near target goals were barely enough to cover inflation.  Health insurance is terrible.  

Busy stores that deal with... many """"backyard mechanics"""" are significantly understaffed as hours are based on sales that they're hoping to get from an average DIY customer, and neglect to take customer count into consideration.  Also, they care little to nothing if you actually know how to help your customers diagnose a car, since they assume their computer software will do it for you (it doesn't).  I was literally told by my regional HR manager that Autozone doesn't recognize ASE certification as something that I could get a raise for.  Instead he said that is something that I should put on my resume.   Great advice, Willie Banks, now i have a much higher paying job!

The commercial program is a joke.  In metro Detroit where parts suppliers are bountiful, somehow Autozone thinks that charging 10% under retail is going to be competitive, and then question why the program is doing so poorly.  Not to mention having minimally staffed delivery drivers putting parts delivery well over an hour in most cases. 

If you are hired and have the skills to work on cars (actually, even if you don't) you are expected to be a parking lot mechanic.  Even if it is -10 degrees out, you are required to put batteries, light bulbs, and wiper blades on customers cars.

The only thing senior and regional management were concerned about were numbers.  If they would treat their employees like people that are looking for a liveable wage, autozone would be doing much better with people who were happy to come to work every day.

Most store managers will not advise their employees when they """"loan"""" them out to other stores until a day before they are scheduled. Store managers need to understand that their employees are human and will be fatigued after working on Setups for 12+ hours and that  every single one of their employees is important from the minute they clock in to the minute they clock out. SM's expect you to be on call on your days off and get personal when you don
t answer their calls even if it is your only day off. Some stores have rodent infestations and very dangerously setup planograms that have very heavy objects in them.

"Working in ANY retail store, you will deal with rude and incompetent customers. Thats a given, so I will give you some more """"AutoZone"""" specific issues that you may or may not come across.

- 90% of your customers do not know anything about the vehicle they need to fix and probably should take it to a shop or send their mechanic to purchase the parts. This also includes the year, make and model of the vehicle.

-... Schedule is going to be unpredictable. You may close one night and open the next morning. You work weekends now. Hard to get 2 consecutive days off in a row. All of this depends on how competent your scheduler is, and if they have a heart they may not screw you too much.

- Pay rate is low. You will live pay check to pay check working this job. You will need 2 jobs to get close to the top of the poverty level. You are expected to do magic tricks for what you do make, however.  Even at the store manager positions, you will work way more than you are compensated. 

- In general, promotions are based on how much you are liked by your superiors vs your actual skills at work. There are many in management who have no idea how to do their jobs. So if you want promotions, sucking up and persistence is key. However this is common in most retail work places. It is in the companies best interest to keep you in the lower position because they can get you to work above your pay grade and save money to increase their stock value. When the store is understaffed, which is usual, it's easy for the company to accomplish.

- If you are a """"red shirt"""", management may look down on you, and categorize you as a """"red shirt"""" instead of a human being. I've been on both sides, and I always made sure to treat those below me with just as much respect as before I got to where I was. You will automatically be treated better by everyone as soon as you """"earn"""" a grey shirt. The whole thing is extremely infantile.

- The most important thing for the company is the stock value for those in corporate. Low pay and consistent understaffing is purposeful to keep expenses down for the 1% to make bank. So the quality of the workplace will always suffer. If you choose to work here, thats your fault, however.",0

Poor... scheduling ensured that there was no way to develop a work-life routine since it was always morphing (you might work ten hours one day and four hours the next). Poor management meant little to no delegation of duties; freight almost always took a week to stock, main store and bathrooms were messy, missing tickets for customer orders, etc. Silly corporate policies like passwords made mundane tasks tedious; workers and customers would grow impatient standing around (sometimes for minutes) until a manager became available to input a password and approve a ninety-nine cent return.

Regardless of your position in the company you are be slave-driven to push their Key Performance Indicator's, or KPI's merchandise. These are things like """"Check Out Challenge,"""" Bulb Grease, Brake Grease, Air Fresheners, etc. Your hours if you are part time will be dependent upon your sales of these KPI products, and your management team will make no bones about it. Part Time employees receive zero benefits. You will be expected to run the store with, at any given time, two or three less people than you would actually need to do so. Hours are constantly being cut back during the week to make up for extra hours on truck day, and the weekends. Your store manager will be placed under a ton of pressure and stress by upper management. If you have a good SM, you'll never know this. If you have a bad one, you will feel every ounce of pressure. Be prepared for this. Don't expect time off on the regular. Even if it is unpaid time off, you will often be denied the ability to take it. The stores are not staffed nearly well enough, and because of lack of employees, your time off will rarely be granted. Pay is average at best. And I mean at best. You will start slightly above minimum wage in most areas. Full time gets you a few more cents, average is $.75 an hour. Entry level management will bring you another $.85 hourly on the average, although my District Manager has always negotiated with me often settling closer to my number than his. The company will rarely back you in anything, so be prepared to stand alone. The store employees and managers will also """"run you over with the bus,"""" not because they are that kind of person, but because often they must save their own skin. You will be expected and required to perform work on customers vehicles such as battery changes, light bulb changes, air filter changers, wiper blade changes, etc. This not weather permitting, and most of this work will come in excessive heat, rain, snow, or freezing cold. The elements cause all of these things to break, which means that is exactly when you will be repairing them. AutoZone is considered an """"essential"""" business, meaning that they nearly never close. Not for extreme weather, not for holidays, rarely ever. Your only promised days off are Thanksgiving and Christmas.",0

"Where do I begin ? The staffing is a joke for starters. Having 2 people in the store is fine until you get more than 2 customers. Then the phones start ringing, someone needs something put in or on there car, and don't forget the """"check engine"""" reading. Once you have that out of the way, then its time to """"up-sale"""", which means trying to get them to buy useless crap that will just sit in their garage and never be used. Once you have already got under their skin, then its time to check out, but wait, we have these overstocked products that we want to sell you for just 5 dollars, and just before you think they are going to say """"screw it, I'll go somewhere else"""", you have to ask them if they have a rewards card. I didn't mind trying to up-sale something if it was really going to be beneficial, ( if your changing your alternator, you might as well replace the belt. You gotta take it off anyway). But they take it to a whole new level. And with just 2 people in the store( which was about 90% of the time), its kind of hard  to try to up-sale people when you got 10 people waiting to be served and 2-3 phone lines ringing. The product on hand they have is just sad. 9 times out of 10, they never have a pair of anything, so you have to call the hub ( trust me, you'd rather pour salt in your eyes) just to see if they have it and if your lucky, will get it the next day. There's plenty of other things I could list """" planograms,overstock,truck,window signs, PCI's, etc, but you get the hint....

"Summary: Long work hours, hard to get promoted, extremely hierarchical, good old boy network, a mom-and-pop shop gone terribly wrong

You are expected to do the work of at least 1 1/2 to 2 full-time jobs so productivity is minimal...you're constantly in reaction mode versus being proactive. Company resources are stretched to the point that progress is stifled. Innovation is non-existent and the party line is that AutoZone is a “company of thrift”. 

Company profits are not spread throughout the organization so front line employees receive nothing for their hard work towards the bottom line. There is a """"good old boy"""" network that exists, so it is VERY difficult (if not impossible) to advance your career if you are 1) female, 2) minority, 3) did not graduate from a local university like Ole Miss or 4) didn't work your way up the chain.

They also tend to hire PSM's instead of promoting from within so they can keep payroll low, and because its easier. ... On average, it seems to take 3-6 months to promote a CSR to PSM, whereas hiring a new PSM off the street can happen in two weeks.

There is almost no accountability at any level.

If nobody wants to buy it you are still held accountable and get written up.  They offer no training or strategy to push it and you don't get any commission or bonus; they just threaten your job.  Another problem is the item on sale is fuel injector cleaner every other... month or products that people aren't interested in.  They also expect you to sell an air filter to 1 out of 4 people who come in and buy an oil change special when you only need to change it every 1-3 years.  It seems the focus in this company is how many unnecessary items you can sell customers and not customer service  They have phone shops where someone randomly calls the store to make sure you are spamming callers with current specials, store hours, and asking to take the customer's information to hold the part for them.  This wouldn't be bad but I work in a store that is constantly busy where there are always lines of customers and the phone is always ringing.  We have to work swiftly to help customers in the store and on the phone and don't have time to worry about the spam they want us to tell people.  The pay is also the lowest compared to competing auto parts stores.  The store is open ridiculous hours especially on the weekends and holidays.

"Confusion and an over tasked agenda is an everyday challenge at Autozone for not just store employees but also field management. Communication at the executive level is very poor, so all too often conflicting tasks or projects are delegated weekly to field and store management. Autozone is very focused on stock performance and stock annalist recommendations and continue to cut expenses and labor to the point that... many stores are dysfunctional and not up to company standards. Training is very poor, and almost nonexistent. New employees spend their first day on the job at an orientation meeting. The next day they are in the store and have to hope the Store Manager has a training plan in place. All training is OJT and since you are trained by a peer that follows no guidelines, since that is how they were trained, procedures and proper execution of duties is not consistent or familiar from store to store.  Of concern also is that due to the high churn rate of employees there is no drug testing on new hires and some negative background checks are ignored due to the pressure to fill open positions. At the Regional level and stores most Managers do a good job and really work on calling out employees for praise for jobs well done. But at the Division and Corporate level most feedback to Regional and lower employees is mostly negative. Corporate discourages any feedback or suggestions from any level of management we all learned that one wrong statement or suggestion can lose you your job. Hence Corporate is not in touch with the realties and challenges of running a store, and also never hear suggestions that could improve operations and the bottom line.",0

Corporate """"culture"""" amounts to infantile mantras and corporate boot licking.  This company constantly issues reports for every little thing that goes on creating a mountain of worthless paperwork. Im surprised they dont keep track of how many times employees go to the bathroom.  The stores are micro... managed to the extreme, the store manager has little authority thus can not act effectively to deal with problems. They treat everyone like they are under suspicion of theft with their overly redundant password system.  Attendance policy is overly strict especially for those with families or school.  The majority of their parts are rebuilt in third world countries and have constant quality control issues.The the lifetime warranty is useless because you will have to change a defective part multiple times so its cheaper in the long run to buy a better part elsewhere. Autozone does not allow employees access to the internet even though it could be a very helpful tool in many situations. Employees get around this by using personal devices to access the net. Technically cell phones are forbidden for anyone but store managers a policy which is obviously impossible to enforce.  The stores are chronically understaffed thus employees are assaulted with a legion of impatient customers. Company policy requires that you answer the phone by the third ring even if you are helping counter customers. This practice is offensive to most people and leads to complaints and mistakes.",0

"There are a lot of rules that are broken all the time.  They tell certain employees they must stay in a position for a specified ltime period before they can apply for other employment, but other employees they allow to post for other positions or they promote them to another position.  They also tell certain employees they must have a degree to apply for certain positions, but other non-degreed employees can apply... and get promoted to positions they stated must have a degree.  

There are some people they tell they can't apply for a position that are a couple levels above their current positions, but there are others they allow to do just that.

The workload is heavy and they keep giving you more work.  However, the pay does not match the work load.  The 2008 pay raise was more than the 2009 pay raise.  We were not told why the raise was lower, and it was not understandable since the company had such a great and profitable year.    It was very confusing.  Like so many other people have said, it would be great if the small people got a piece of the pie.  I think all of the positions should receive a bonus or decent pay increase, when it's a profitable year.  It would have been more understanding for the pay increase to be cut in 2008 rather than 2009.  Oh, the pay increase is only good for a month, because your health insurance is going to eat that up in January.  You are lucky if that's all, because sometimes the increase in health benefits takes part of the salary you were used to before the raise.  

Speaking on benefits, every year they cover less, but cost more.  You are forced to chose between going to the doctor and paying your bills.  Most doctor visits after co-pay will land you a mailed bill for services such as lab work.

We are rated or graded on everything we do.  You maybe considered part time and only on the schedule for 30 hours a week but you may... work more than that without being considered full time and get the benefits. We are expected to keep our store emaculate only problem is that We are a very high volume store and they only keep two people staffed at night and day people generally could care less about helping out.",0
"they expect a person to work as many hours as needed in a day but refuse to pay overtime instead leave early or extend a lunch hour to loose the extra time worked. pay is very low and they tell us the way to higher pay is thru promotion but  promotions are very rare and they always hire new people to fill these positions",0
"This is one of the companies that believe that the customer is always right.  The problem with this is the customers commonly walk all over you because the manager on duty or district manager wants no complaints from the customers to get above him.  Honestly he doesn't want to hear about any of it either.

All the people I know trying to support families off their pay are stretched incredibly thin even with a... spouse working, but that could be most jobs today.

I have been promised advancement for about two years now, but it hasn't happened.

There is plenty of employee theft and they always point to the lack of pay as being a reason (I still don't agree with it).

There are plenty of rumors of employees sleeping together, cheating with coworkers, using sex to advance in the company, etc.

Employees are expected to work longer without a break longer than allowed by law.

Problem employees can be incredibly difficult to get rid of, even if plenty of evidence is gathered.  Meanwhile,  good employees can be fired for not jumping through the correct hoops.

There are lots of little things Autozone tracks to make sure you're """"doing your job'.  This includes asking people loads of questions when they call and trying to get customers to make lots of last minute purchases (customers often don't even register what you say).",0
"Not thought of as a place to grow a career.  Very rigid--very little teamwork.  Communciations is spotty, contradictory, confusing, inaccurate, incomplete.

"There is no incentives.  It make us more money we aren't makeing enough push this product, push that product.  The store manager and district managers get bonuses and awarded with prizes when their store (stores) do well.  The employees get nothing or a pizza.  Communication isn't always what it should be.  When there is a store meeting it's always the same.  """"The Cheer"""",  Make us more money, closing cheer.    The... products have gone downhill.  Too much made in Mexico and China.  Valucraft is Value Crap.  Too many electrical parts are taken back after they have been tried on customers cars.",0
"The health benefits are below average.  Part time/new employees get benefits immediately but you are better off buying much better insurance on your own.  You have to work as full time for one full year before being eligible for the better health benefits.

You are required to test parts before returning or exchanging them.  Many employees have a poor understanding of parts due to lack of training and may not... warranty something like a bad starter with a faulty solenoid.  They think if it tests good on the tester there is no way it is bad, even if it really is.  The same thing is done with batteries.  You are monitored on visible reports with testing warranty returns.   You are highly monitored on what you sell with a new report coming out each week, but you aren't rewarded for your hard work besides getting a star next to your score that is above average.

Pay is comparable to a fast food.   Your annual raise is usually a joke.  I would say 6-24 cent raises are common with an average to great annual review.  The only way to get a decent raise is to move up to a higher position.  You will then again get stuck with a measly raise after a year in the higher position.  

The company is suppose to pay for your uniform/shirt in my state but they don't.  Everyone knows this but nobody follows it nor dares to bring it up.  Many good policies are in place by corporate but these policies are rarely followed by local management.  This year we were told to stop salting icy sidewalks because it wasn't in our budget.  A slip in fall accident would cost more than the salt but common sense doesn't prevail.  Store manager bonuses are based on profit so some Mr. Scrooge type of store managers won't pay to have things done or replaced that should be. 

 When ringing someone up at the register during the holidays you have to ask them if they want to donate money.  You then have to ask them if they have an Autozone Rewards card.  You then have to ask them if they want the current promotional item.  You are expected to ask these questions at every purchase.  Customers get frustrated if they are in a hurry of if the store is busy when you ask them a question, then follow with another question and finally third question.  In the non-holiday season you only have to ask two questions.

The stores have a poor/worsening appearance on the inside. The floors need to be redone in any store that isn't relatively new.  You would think for being a fortune 500 company things would be nicer but they aren't.

You are expected to answer the phone by the third ring.  In busy stores this is impossible unless you can interrupt the customer you are helping multiple times to answer the phone and listen fully to what the customer on the phone wants before placing them on hold.  It seems that the busy stores don't have enough employees to help during busy times and that Autozone wants to have their cake and eat it too. 

The loss prevention people consider you guilty until proven innocent.  Don't dare drink or open something before paying for it.  Autozone is hell bent on thinking their number one cause of theft is employees.  If there is a loss prevention blitz and they visit your store expect to get interrogated like you just murdered the presidentand you have something to hide.
  
In the past Autozone had a just say yes policy where you would  do whatever the customer wanted.  Crooked people took advantage of this so you will get some cracked out people who took a part of a car at a junk yard and are now wanting to return it for cash although there is no warranty or receipt.  Autozone is just like Wal-mart and has had to make adjustments because of return abuse.  Some customers still feel like they should be able to return a 50 yr old kitchen sink for cash without a receipt.

The turnover rate is high and job morale can be absolute crap if you have a poor store manager.  If I would have started at a fast food joint compared to Autozone I could probably be in a higher position making more money.  If you are retired and don't care about management , reports or pay then Autozone may be a better option if you like cars.",0
"pay is on the low side. hours can be long. dm;s offer no help depending on who  u have. pay for holidays for salary",0
"Auto Zone has attempted to become the Walmart of the automotive retail aftermarket.  Upper management could care less how slammed the employees on the counter are, as long as earnings per share keep increasing.  They devote too little payroll and resources to training.  They pay low retail wages and expect to get stellar employees.",0
"Really weak in marketing. CMO is terrible. Completely superficial. No strategy. Terrible execution. Not everything needs to be a crisis.",0
"I do not see any Cons.",0
"Too much internal process to deal with",0
"Relocation and compression of back office business teams",0
"commute can be a hassle",0
"Crazy management and culture that does not value  its workers",0
"Lots of cold-calling, trade-off between base and commissions.",0
"Poor leadership 
Outdated technology
Not a lot of opportunities  for advancement",0
"Constantly restructuring and """"right"""" sizing.",0
"Terrible communication between upper management and employees.  Opportunity for growth is limited.  Compensation is on the low side.",0
"Let go due to economy in 2009",0

"Work tools are not the best - IT does not look at employees as their clients",0
"AXA is moving almost all jobs and positions to their Service Center in Charlotte, NC.  If you want to move there, Great.  If not, then it is Bad.  Also a move to NC will also mean your Comp. will be ties to a NC comparable salary or wage, even if your live in NY Metro area and work remotely.  In addition, while they say """"Employees are our best asset"""", they do not follow that philosophy.",0
"If you are a satisfactory worker, which they believe is 70 percent of all workers, then your salary is capped at 40 percent of the market value.",0
"Upper management is group of dimwitted pretenders with a myopic focus on short-term incentive. They are either not qualified to run a insurance company or care too little to understand what's going on. No IPO or similar moves would save the company - to believe otherwise is to ignore the underlying problem, poor management.",0
"Was bought out by bigger company then many let go.",0
"I'll start by saying I am not a disgruntled former employee.  Major complaint with AXA starts with senior management and the highly charged political environment of being a subsidiary company within the AXA group.  Senior management has a """"do more with less"""" attitude like I've never seen before.  They want a world class business  operation without putting man/woman power behind it.  Plus you have to deal with... rediculous demands and requirements from the parent company.  10 to 12 hour days are the norm, and that won't even get you ahead of your work load.  You will always be behind.",0
"Some of the managers should not be people managers.",0
"need more internal promotion 
demanding",0
"Unfortunately due to the economy the company outsourced many jobs to India.",0
"Not much cons.
Need more space to grow.",0
"The management micromanages everything you do, they nitpick anything you do through your day to try and make you more robotic.",0
"The working environment is horrible, the management micromanages all that you do.",0
"Layoff threat every single year that I worked there",0
"The company's ambition exceeds its commitment to staffing and compensating appropriately. The focus now is on reducing the average age of its workforce and getting people to work ever longer hours. There is a great deal of talk about work life balance but it is talk.",0
"Innovative only on the paper; unable to recruit and/or retain best talents; weak brand in US (AXA); unclear career path",0
"your job will be outsourced",0
"Constantly changing environment which can be worrisome for stability.",0
"Because the main headquarters are in France, it seems that upper management cannot do anything without asking the Mother ship",0
"No matter how great or hard you try to do and be your best, they will walk you out instead of trying to build you up to be a better employee",0
"Going through significant change and cost cutting through outsourcing and personal cuts. Total compensation package is probably below industry average. Technology is also not a strength but is improving.",0
"Lack of clear understanding when initiatives will be implemented.
Raise and bonus structure are weakly implemented, you either get both or none, no increase in compensation if you hit almost all your goals, its all or nothing. 
High focus on call volumes, less focus on customer-centric activities.",0
"Need more consistency and solid decisions made and kept.",0
"You will get laid off, only accept if you're looking for a temp position",0
"Senior Leaders are out of touch with the reality of the operation.  Instead of holding individuals accountable, they go to others in the organization to do the work.  This causes a culture of frustration and finger pointing.  If I can get them to look at what you're not doing right then they will leave me a lone.",0
"There are layoff as the corporate direction changes and this can add instability to the situation. Also working with off shore resources add strange hours on occasion.",0
"Downsizing, no real sense of job security, disrespect and an extreme lack of direction. Communication was weak, and compensation was not equitable.",0
"AXA used to value employees who were committed to work hard who wanted to build their career with the company,  AXA has moved to a company that is better suited to build your resume at but is no longer a preferred employer to build a career.",0
"Unfortunately there were constant layoffs. No real sense of job security",0
"CUrrent comp and benefits for Advisors has been changed to a less favorable program for average production advisors.",0
"The clear vision of roles and responsibilities can get lost in red tape and it can be very political.",0
"Continual restructuring and hierarchy changes each year. Little opportunity for advancement outside of Branch office if not in production role. Heavy sales and recruiting emphasis recognized over any staff contributions. Variable compensation influenced negatively by poor performance of company assets gathered in prior years often negating reward for current successes.",0
"Very silo'd culture and business process across departments...not really much innovation or chances to really challenge the status quo",0
"Insurance companies all have red tape you have to know it from the start.

A little slow to set up technology on new hires, the help desk is outsourced overseas frustrating getting the answers off the screen. Takes a few tries to get someone who gets it solved but they are polite.",0
"Horrible culture, Lack of leadership, Products are not market leading, No trust at all",0
"There are continuous changes in the company",0
"changes in management have caused instability",0
"Senior management was, and apparently still is, hell bent on outsourcing to India and ultimately drained this company of all of it talent - all the in the name of short term stock increases.   Annuity product offerings were a misguided failure and ultimately all of this combined so that today the stock price they so desperately wanted to influence is a total flop.",0
"Life work balance does not exist, it's too much load. No comp time regardless of overtime hours you put in.",0
"Very unstable environment. Lots of layoffs.  Management does not communicate clear strategy.  Employees are not happy or optimistic of the outlook for the company. People are leaving en masse.  Very low moral.  Frequent change in senior management disrupts work flow and direction.  Those in favor get paid well, others get paid very little.  Promotions mean more work, better title, but same pay.",0
"No career growth, No 401 K match, Average Salaries, managers lack training in managing reportees, 
Products are complex and outdated. technologically behind in the market.",0
"No 401k match, below average performance increases, significant management, leadership and other employee turnover, salaries are not as competetive than in the past",0
"- The new senior management team, which joined in 2011, is completely out of touch with the employees.  Morale could not be lower.  
- The industry is experiencing struggles in general, but senior management is attacking the problems with very little imagination.  Cutting employees and leasing costs will not create growth.",0
"No employer match
Cost of health insurance keeps rising, while benefits are decreasing
Both mid and upper management can be inept and clueless.
New computer systems are causing more problems than they are fixing.
Layoffs happening more and more just for the sake of trying to save a dollar.",0
"People are leaving because the compensation is not competitive, and there is little to no hope that things will get better within the next year.",0
"Management was constantly changing.  As soon as you got accustomed to one style of management you had a new manager.",0
"Tough industry with current economy",0
"waiting for opportunities with mediocre pay",0
"not much room for career growth, recognition could be better",0
"Somewhat slow paced, but maybe some else's Pros.",0
"Never enough time, people or money to do it right, so just do it over.

Job abolishments have eliminated too many key people in some areas without input from the impacted area's management (e.g., blindside job abolishment of  a manager's employees by a manger several levels up). Upper management  is unwilling to be accountable for, or admit to mistakes made in abolishment decisions. 

No long-term commitment to... most plans. No financial support to maintain/update implemented  software systems.

Only talk the talk of """"valuing"""" the individual. Ageism is rampant.  If employees are """"the company's greatest asset"""" why are so many of those with a wealth of knowledge on the company workings culture/history the ones who are outplaced?  Doing your job well has no real impact on keeping it (my lowest evaluation was exceeds expectations)!.

Politics, nepotism and/or favoritism are your best hopes for recognition, to keep your job or be promoted.",0
"pay grades are low for the industry
little opportunity for advancement if not in NYC
agents treated like kings; employees like serfs
they pay lip service to HR policies, ethics code, culture, values, etc. but don't follow them
Hierarchy & bureaucracy make it hard to get anything done or changed",0
"There is no work life balance. None. People work very hard with no recognition. You get a lot of vacation days but good luck trying to use them. The pay is fair and benefits are pretty good. It is a big sacrifice though for the work load and hours you put in. Management is terrible. It is the old boys network at its best. Promotions are based on favoritism. Company struggles with strategic direction and moves from... one product to another in hopes that it will be a """"game changer"""" but so far nothing seems to stick in the market. The former head of HR (Blevins) allowed her few favorites to run the entire show and to the detriment of the entire department. If you work outside of NYC (even in Jersey City), you will be a second class citizen.",0
"Blatent favoritism; lack of communication within department.",0
"takes a while to get promoted, typical political scenario",0
"Not much growth.  Some departmets are laid back and lack the sense of urgency. Good place to work if you are not ambitious or close to retirement..",0
"In your first 5 years, it's going to be a very hard job.  Nothing will be given to you, YOU have to go do it.",0
"Serious lack of communication and overall disconnect between senior management and sales desk.  Serious lack of job security and management seems to promote based on favorites rather then those who perform.  Recent round of layoffs confirm that despite performance of employees,  layoffs seem to be personal to some degree.",0
"Company is very political and playing the game is the only way to get anything done
People are promoted for techical skill and favoritism so there are lot of """"bad"""" managers",0
"Lack of transparency and communication up & down. Senior mgmt doesn't visit field and live's in a """"bubble"""". Only allowed to advance 2 levels every other year per HR no matter what job you qualify for as opposed to senior mgmt hiring copious numbers of outsiders to high levels. No merit promotions. Very little recognition to successful efforts at lower levels. Large bonuses and salaries paid to upper mgmt for no... visibly useful contributions to revenue production. High expectations, low support, and no IT functionality. Second wave of layoffs (not announced) just occured.",0
"Many changes in the past two years.  Tougher management.  No fun.",0
"Senior management: it doesn't seem that they really care about employees.  Lack of communication from senior management.  Production is pushed so hard that quality suffers.",0
"Management does not always seem to be as knowledgeable as the people they are managing.  Some people tended to be satisfied with the status quo & one got the sense that people just wanted to ride out their time until retirement.  They didn't want to go anywhere else primarily because of the familiarity of the company; yet, they didn't want to strive extremely hard to do more at AXA.  The people in some areas of the... company overall are not very skilled and seem to have no concern about this.  However, in all fairness I believe the company was actively looking to improve the quality of its' employees.",0
"Recognition, large company, restacking, move to NJ, bad feel and people leaving company",0
