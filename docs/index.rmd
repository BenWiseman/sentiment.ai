## Overview

We made `sentiment.ai` for researchers and tinkerers who want a straight-forward way to
use open source deep learning models to improve their sentiment analyses. We've wrapped a lot of the 
underlying hassle up to make the process as simple as possible. In addition to just being cool, this approach solves several problems with traditional sentiment analysis, namely: 

1) It is **case-insensitive**, can **handle spelling mitsakes**, and can be applied to **16 languages**! 

2) It **doesn't need to match words to a ridged lexicon**, rather it matches to an embedding vector (reduces language to a vector of numbers that capture the information, kind of like a PCA). This means you can get scores for words that are not in the lexicon but are similar to existing words! 

3) You can **choose the context** for what negative and positive mean. For example, you could set `positive` to mean `"high quality"` and negative to mean `"low quality"` when looking at product reviews.


4) **Power** Because it draws from models trained on billions of texts, news articles, and wikipedia entries, it is able to detect things such as *"I learned so much on my trip to Hiroshima museum last year!"* is associated with something positive and that *"What happeded to the people of Hiroshima in 1945"* is associated with something negative. 


### Simple Example

<input onclick="change()" type="button" class="collapsible" value="Open Code"></input>
<div class="content">
```{r example1, echo=TRUE, eval=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# Load the package
require(sentiment.ai)
require(SentimentAnalysis)
require(sentimentr)

# Only if it's your first ever time
# sentiment.ai.install()

# Initiate the model
# This will create the sentiment.ai.embed model in your environment
sentiment.ai.init(model = "en")

## Installation

After installing `sentiment.ai` from CRAN, you will need to make sure you have a compatible python environment for `tensorflow` and `tensorflow-text`. As this can be a cumbersome experience, we included a 
convenience function to install that for you:

`sentiment.ai.install()` 

This only needs to be run the first time you install the package. If you're feeling adventurous, you can modify the environment it will create with the following paramaters:

* `envname` - the name of the virtual environment

* `method` - if you specifically want "conda" or "virtualenv" 

* `gpu` - set to TRUE if you want to run tensorflow-gpu

* `python_version` - The python version used in the virtual environment 

* `modules` - a names list of the dependencies and versions



<input onclick="change()" type="button" class="collapsible" value="Open Example"></input>
<div class="content">
```{r echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}

# Just leave this as default unless you have a good reason to change it. 
# This is quite dependent on specific versions of python moduules
sentiment.ai.install()

```
</div>

## Basic Usage

### `sentiment_easy`

Returns a vector of sentiment scores. The scores are the maximum closeness (cosine simalirity) to a positive or negative example. If the max similarity was to a negative item, the score is returned as a negative value. 

* `model` two defaults are `en` and `multi`. `en` is a shortcut to Universal Sentence Encoder English (large) which has better performance but only works on English, `multi` is the U.S.E Multi-language (large) that has good performance on 16 different languages. 

* 

* `batch_szie` determines how many rows are processed at a time. On CPU this doesn't change much, but can be important if you installed the GPU version. Put simply, small bathes take longer but use less RAM/VRAM, large batches run faster on GPU but could exhaust VRAM if too large. 

* `environment` if you installed into a custom environment, you can specify it here (ignored if you called `sentiment.ai_init()` in the same session.)
